# image_segmentation
The objective of this project is to enhance the segmentation model's accuracy by altering the data structure from a single image representing one image to one image representing three images in chronological order.

1. `MODIFIED_DATA.ipynb`: A code file designed to transform data, converting from a single image representing one image to one image representing three images in chronological order.
2. `MERGE_DATA.ipynb`: A code file focused on merging folders.
3. `SEGMENTATION_MODEL.ipynb`: A code file dedicated to building or utilizing a segmentation model.
